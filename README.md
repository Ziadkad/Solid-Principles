# SolidPrinciples

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of the SOLID principles, a set of five design principles for writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code. Each principle focuses on a different aspect of software design, aiming to make our code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Principles Demonstrated
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Classes should have only one reason to change. 
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## Usage
To explore each principle in action, navigate to the respective directories in this repository. Each principle is demonstrated with practical examples and explanations to help you understand its importance and how to apply it in your own projects.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance this project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the examples, adding new principles, or enhancing the explanations, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
